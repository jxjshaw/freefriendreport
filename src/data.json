Last summer, I was able to meet someone who works for that team, and she told me about how they were working with a video game company to integrate a Facebook login into the game. I thought it was really interesting how Facebook was helping to make the game more social, especially since I usually play games with my friends on weekends as a way to relax. \n\nI was also really impressed with the culture of the Seattle office. The employees emphasized the \"small office\"-type culture, even though they were in the process of expanding to a bigger office. The campus at MPK is huge, so I think it would be great to work in a smaller location.\n\nI'm very strongly planning on moving to Seattle after graduation. As of now, I don't have a desire to move to California, so that's one of the other reasons why I would prefer to work in the Seattle office.\n\nDo you think it will still be possible for me to work there since it is already so late in the recruiting season and I visited a couple of months ago?
